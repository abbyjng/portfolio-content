        The Discord bot designed to help keep group finances simple. Moolah can
        be used for any group from a short vacation group of 15 to a long term
        roommate relationship of 3. This easy-to-use bot simplifies what would
        normally be dozens of Venmo charges into just a few, or as many as you'd
        like. Moolah reduces clutter and shows you only what you need to know
        while also maintaining all the details you might need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using simple commands, transactions can easily be logged, deleted, and
        reviewed, all while using a non-intrusive edited logging embed to always
        display the overall charges for the group.

        Moolah is a project which I started working on during the summer of 2020
        in my free time. It was originally called RoomieBot and was personalized
        specifically for me and my roommates. It was bug-ridden, but it worked
        enough for the four of us. However, when the summer of 2021 rolled
        around, I decided I wanted to challenge myself to make this bot better
        than ever, and I worked hard to design it in a manner that's easy for
        new users to understand so that anyone could set it up if they wanted
        to. Moolah is on its final iteration, and I hope to continue to maintain
        it as it grows in its userbase.
